# Song-Downloader
Downloads songs from a list

# Usage:

Make a text file and put song titles into it with a new line seperating them:

    Never Gonna Give You Up
    It Would Take A Strong Strong Man
    She Wants to Dance with Me
    Whenever You Need Sombody
    Move Right Out

        > python3 downloader.py
    > Song list: {The file of the songs you would like to download
                  Adds .txt extension if none is given}
    > Output folder: {The location of the folder where the songs are downloaded to
                      Makes a new folder if there is none}
